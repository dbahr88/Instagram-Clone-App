# Instagram Clone App - NYCDA

## Goal
Develop an application that will allow users to create a local account and upload images.

## Assignment
Most hiring managers we have interviewed told us they expect their Junior Web Developers to work well in teams and show the ability to complete a project from start to finish. This project is a great way to show potential employers that you can do both. Plus, you can add this project to your portfolio ;)

For this project, work in a small group of 2-3 people, to develop an application that resembles Instagram. The application should have a basic file upload feature and user authentication.
